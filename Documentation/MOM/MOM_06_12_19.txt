06/12/19 - Exercise Notes

Apply classical hazard analysis and get the hazards, then apply STAMP
Heirerchy is important
Cyclical approach, find out hazards from current use case diagrams and then change use case, then 
find requirements, do hazard analysis, come up with safety plan, come up with safety requirements and add to initial requirements
